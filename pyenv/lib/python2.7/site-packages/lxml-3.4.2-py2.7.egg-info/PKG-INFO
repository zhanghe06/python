Description: lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It
        provides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree
        API.
        
        It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
        RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.
        
        To contact the project, go to the `project home page
        <http://lxml.de/>`_ or see our bug tracker at
        https://launchpad.net/lxml
        
        In case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml,
        you can get it from the github repository at
        https://github.com/lxml/lxml .  Note that this requires Cython to
        build the sources, see the build instructions on the project home
        page.  To the same end, running ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will
        install lxml from
        https://github.com/lxml/lxml/tarball/master#egg=lxml-dev if you have
        an appropriate version of Cython installed.
        
        
        After an official release of a new stable series, bug fixes may become
        available at
        https://github.com/lxml/lxml/tree/lxml-3.4 .
        Running ``easy_install lxml==3.4bugfix`` will install
        the unreleased branch state from
        https://github.com/lxml/lxml/tarball/lxml-3.4#egg=lxml-3.4bugfix
        as soon as a maintenance branch has been established.  Note that this
        requires Cython to be installed at an appropriate version for the build.
